# SimplifiedML
Extremely simplified machine learning project to understand the concepts of machine learning (as opposed to proper implementation) in tic tac toe.

Uses basic programming concepts to show how machine learning works without using machine learning packages or advanced algorithms. As a general software engineer, I had trouble understanding mathematical concepts that commonly appear in machine learning articles so I tried implementing the concepts in a language I understood to aid my learning. I hope others can gleam as much I did during my development of this.
